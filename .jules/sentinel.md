## 2026-09-06 - Prevent Unrestricted Database Sorting (Query Manipulation)
**Vulnerability:** The API allowed users to sort threat indicators using any arbitrary string passed to the `sortBy` query parameter. This string was used directly in a Prisma `orderBy: { [sortBy]: sortOrder }` clause.
**Learning:** This exposes the application to query manipulation, which can allow attackers to infer hidden database schema structure, sort by unindexed/large columns causing database DoS, or trigger unhandled server errors by specifying non-existent columns.
**Prevention:** Always restrict sort columns using an allowlist or enum. In this monorepo, the shared Zod schema (`packages/shared/src/schemas.ts`) should strictly validate inputs via `z.enum()` rather than `z.string()` before values reach the database layer.
## 2026-09-09 - Sentinel: Fix Application Crash (DoS) Vulnerability
**Vulnerability:** DoS due to unhandled promise rejection in parsing csv content when express.text parser is missing
**Learning:** Ensure that payloads are correctly parsed using express built-in parsers. By omitting `express.text({ type: 'text/csv' })`, `req.body.toString()` threw an exception when an unauthenticated POST was sent with `Content-Type: text/csv`.
**Prevention:** Add `app.use(express.text({ type: 'text/csv' }));` globally or locally at the route level to handle csv requests.
## 2024-03-07 - [MEDIUM] Missing Input Validation for ID Parameters
**Vulnerability:** The endpoints `/api/v1/indicators/:id` and `/api/v1/indicators/:id/enrich` were accepting arbitrary string inputs for the `:id` parameter without validation. Since the database schema expects a UUID for the primary key, sending non-UUID strings to the Prisma client would result in unhandled database errors (HTTP 500) and potential information leakage if errors aren't perfectly scrubbed.
**Learning:** Even simple parameterized routes (`/:id`) require explicit validation matching the database schema (e.g., UUID) to ensure resilience against malformed inputs and prevent unnecessary DB queries.
**Prevention:** Always validate all path parameters using tools like `zod` and integrate them with the routing middleware (like the existing `validate` function) before passing them to the ORM.

## Prevention Directives for Automated Refactoring
- **Never Overwrite Complete Files**: Always use range-scoped replacement chunks for edits to `schema.prisma`, `index.ts`, `public/index.php`, `db/schema.rb`, or DDL SQL scripts.
- **Do Not Remove Core Declarations**: Do not delete existing route registrations or database DDL tables.
- **Environment Isolation Compatibility**: When replacing fallback secrets, preserve test environment execution via `!getenv('APP_ENV')` or `getenv('APP_ENV') === 'testing'`.
- **No Scratch Files**: Never stage or commit `test_*.ts`, `test_*.js`, `test.cjs`, `fix_*.php`, or `test.js` files to git.
- **No Unresolved Conflict Markers**: Never stage or commit files containing Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`, `|||||||`). Always resolve conflicts cleanly before committing.

## Completeness & Verification Directives
- **Explicit Parameter & Contract Validation**: When creating or modifying API endpoints (Express, Fastify, Rails, Laravel), always implement explicit parameter and request body validation schemas (e.g. `z.string().uuid()`) to prevent unhandled 404/500 fallthroughs.
- **Database Indexing for Queries**: When addressing query bottlenecks or adding query lookup filters, always implement native database index migrations rather than loading collections into memory and performing array filtering (`.filter()`, `.select`).
- **Co-Occurring Dependency Auditing**: When bumping any dependency version, verify that other transitive dependencies do not carry high/critical security advisories (e.g. run `bundler-audit`, `npm audit`). Never introduce a version bump that breaks underlying framework APIs.
- **Self-Verification Before Commit**: Always run syntax checks (`bash -n` for shell scripts, `tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript, linter checks) and targeted test runners locally before opening or updating a PR.

## Hallucinatory Task & Empty PR Directives
- **Zero-Diff Task Termination**: If the requested optimization, refactor, or fix is ALREADY natively present in the target branch, DO NOT create an empty pull request or commit an acknowledgment PR. Exit the task cleanly without opening a PR.
- **Stale Suggestion Guard**: Always verify the current code on `main`/`master` before planning changes. If no actionable diff is required, cancel task execution immediately.
